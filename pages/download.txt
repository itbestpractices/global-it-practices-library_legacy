===== Download and Customise your own ALM Library Instance =====

This ALM Library is a combination of (free) open source tools and commercially available software. The library will function exactly the same with or without the commercial plugins, they do however add to the useability of the system. the section [[:download#commercial plugins|Commercial Plugins]] explains more about the differences in user experience.

Before you get started is a good idea to have a look at the System Requirements for hosting an ALM Library an plan accordingly.
