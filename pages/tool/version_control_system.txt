==== Description ====

An important part of Software Delivery is managing source code. Allowing multiple versions of an application to co-exist in environments, while managing enhancements to each version, requires mature source control processes. The tools to help development teams perform these tasks are called Version Control System (VCS) tools. There are many VCS tools currently on the market and the variation in functionality within those tools is also quite big.

==== Advise ====

The advice is:
  * GIT is the default central Version Control System for all technologies including Microsoft technology based development.
  * However, if a Microsoft technology based project intends to use the additional features of TFS, then we support that too.
