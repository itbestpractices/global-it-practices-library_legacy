===== How to use Rigrr in DokuWiki =====

The Rigrr library gives the user the ability to include process maps inside their wiki pages. This is particularly useful to show complicated processes work alternative flows or cross-competency workflows. Having the diagrams embedded in the pages means that the surrounding text can provide more context and/or more detail to understand the process map better.

Even though the Rigrr library can render any BPMN document coming from any BPM tool that exports to BPMN, it is recommended to use either the basic [[http://rigrr.rapilabs.com|BPMN online tool]] or the commercially available DokuWiki plugin that allows for tight integration between the library and the library.

When using the online application the following process needs to be followed:
  * Open the online application ([[http://rigrr.rapilabs.com|BPMN online tool]])
  * Create the drawing. Help is available in the application if needs be.
  * Export the drawing to BPMN by choosing "File -> Save" from the menu. Click "Select" and use CTRL+C to copy the selected text to the clipboard.
  * Open a wiki page in edit more and add the following code:

<code>
   <rigrr>

   <<BPMN GOES HERE>>

   </rigrr>
</code>

  * Replace the <<BPMN GOED HERE>>  with the BPMN copied from the Rigrr online application

=== Known issues ===

  * Only one process map per wiki page.
  * Clicking on links will open the sub-process (or rather linked wiki page) in a new browser window.
