===== ALM Maturity Model: Reporting =====

==== Description ====



==== Metrics ====

Reporting: how we drive transparency (for quality)

  * Visibility: increasing transparency drives the team to higher quality, and allows cross project comparison & learning
  * Traceability: being able to track why change occur, from end user feature to code, config and environment changes allows quicker fixing and trend detection
  * Integration: how well integrated is information sharing within the project team, is there one information repository or unconnected datasets (bugs not related to builds for example)
  * Defects: how defects are tracked and related to changes in the system enables better investigation and reporting
