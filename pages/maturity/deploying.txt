===== ALM Maturity Model: Deploying =====

Deploying: how we deploy into environments

  * Deployment: how we make a release live, making this painless and automated reduces friction to testing and rapid evolution
  * Resource: what skills are needed to deploy, having special skills constraints becomes a blocker, ultimately it should be the final output of CI
  * Database: repositories and databases need to be deployable as easily as the application
  * Environment: having well defined standard environments with automation allows for creation of test environments and additional live capacity automatically
