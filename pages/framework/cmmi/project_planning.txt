====== Project Planning CMMi Process Area ======

A Project Management Process Area at Maturity Level 2

**Purpose**

The purpose of Project Planning (PP) is to establish and maintain plans that 
define project activities. 

**Introduction**

One of the keys to effectively managing a project is project planning. The Project Planning process area involves the following activities: 
  * Developing the project plan 
  * Interacting with relevant stakeholders appropriately
  * Getting commitment to the plan 
  * Maintaining the plan 

Planning includes estimating the attributes of work products and tasks, determining the resources needed, negotiating commitments, producing a schedule, and identifying and analyzing project risks. Iterating through these activities may be necessary to establish the project plan. The project plan provides the basis for performing and controlling project activities that address commitments with the project’s customer.(See the definition of “project” in the glossary.)

The project plan is usually revised as the project progresses to address changes in requirements and commitments, inaccurate estimates, 
corrective actions, and process changes. Specific practices describing both planning and replanning are contained in this process area. 
The term “project plan” is used throughout this process area to refer to the overall plan for controlling the project. The project plan can be a standalone document or be distributed across multiple documents. In either case, a coherent picture of who does what should be included. Likewise, monitoring and control can be centralized or distributed, as long as at the project level a coherent picture of project status can be maintained. 

   For product lines, there are multiple sets of work activities that would
   benefit from the practices of this process area. These work activities include 
   the creation and maintenance of the core assets, developing products to be built 
   using the core assets, and orchestrating the overall product line effort to 
   support and coordinate the operations of the inter-related work groups and 
   their activities. 
   
   In Agile environments, performing incremental development 
   involves planning, monitoring, controlling, and re-planning more frequently 
   than in more traditional development environments. While a high-level plan 
   for the overall project or work effort is typically established, teams will 
   estimate, plan, and carry out the actual work an increment or iteration at 
   a time. Teams typically do not forecast beyond what is known about the project 
   or iteration, except for anticipating risks, major events, and large-scale 
   influences and constraints. Estimates reflect iteration and team specific 
   factors that influence the time, effort, resources, and risks to accomplish 
   the iteration. Teams plan, monitor, and adjust plans during each iteration 
   as often as it takes (e.g., daily). Commitments to plans are demonstrated 
   when tasks are assigned and accepted during iteration planning, user stories 
   are elaborated or estimated, and iterations are populated with tasks from a 
   maintained backlog of work. (See ―"Interpreting CMMI When Using Agile 
   Approaches" in Part I.)
