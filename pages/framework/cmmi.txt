** From WikiPedia **

   Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) is a process improvement training and 
   certification program and service administered and marketed by Carnegie Mellon 
   University and required by many DOD and U.S. Government contracts, especially 
   software development. 
   
   Carnegie Mellon University claims CMMI can be used to guide process improvement across a
   project, division, or an entire organization. Under the CMMI methodology, processes are
   rated according to their maturity levels, which are defined as: Initial, Repeatable, Defined,
   Quantitatively Managed, Optimizing. Currently supported is CMMI Version 1.3. CMMI is 
   registered in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office by Carnegie Mellon University.
