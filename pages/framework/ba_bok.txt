The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) is a globally recognized standard for the practice of business analysis. It is written for the purpose of defining the skills and knowledge required by a skilled practitioner. BABOK is recognized as a standard of business analysis for all organizations and global regions. It is thorough yet flexible enough to apply to any industry or skill level of the analysts. The Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (BABOK) is a written guide for business analysis knowledge reflecting the current best practices, and thus providing a framework that elaborates the domains of knowledge, with the associated activities and tasks and skills that are required therein. According to Capability Maturity Model Integration //[[:general:glossary|glossary]]// business organizations looking for process improvements need to adopt industry standards from the Business Analysis Body of Knowledge (or other associated references) to enhance their project delivery from the ad-hoc to the managed level efficiency. 

The BABOK was initially released by the International Institute of Business Analysis (IIBA)((http://www.iiba.org/imis15/IIBA/Home/IIBA_Website/Home.aspx?hkey=98c9dd81-d341-4a6e-a68a-e9cbc12536c9)) as a draft document version 1.4, in October 2005. It was intended to have consultation with the wider business analysis and the project management community, and to document and standardise generally accepted business analysis practices. The first formal release of BABOK was the version 1.6 issued in June 2006, and it was followed by the Version 2.0 released on 31 March 2009. BABOK has been defined and updated by the business analysis professionals who use it on a daily basis and it is under active review and consultation. The development of the latest BABOK Guide version 3 started in May, 2011 in Toronto, Canada. IIBA has created the Certified Business Analysis Professional (CBAP) program to recognise the senior business analysts who can demonstrate an in-depth long-term experience in these knowledge areas (with 5 to 10 years in a dedicated business analyst role). IIBA also offers the Certification of Competency on Business Analysis (CCBA) program that is intended to recognize the Business Analysts with over 3750 hours business analysis experience, inclusive of 900 hours of experience in two knowledge areas or 500 hours of experience in four knowledge areas, and 21 professional development hours. 

**Key Concepts**
The key concepts of BABOK are:
1.	Domain – It is the area of the business that is undergoing analysis. It may relate to the boundaries of an organization or organizational unit, as well as the key stakeholders outside those boundaries and the interactions with those stakeholders
2.	Solution – It is a set of the changes in the current state of an organization that are made to enable the organization to meet a business need, solve a problem, or take the advantage of an opportunity. Most of the solutions are systems of interacting solution components
3.	Requirement - It is a condition needed by a stakeholder to solve a problem or achieve an objective or a capability that must be met or possessed by a solution component to satisfy a contract, standard, specification, or other formally imposed documents. It also relates to the documented representation of this condition or capability. According to the BABOK Guide the requirements are again classified into the following types: Business Requirements; Stakeholder Requirements; Solution Requirements and Transition Requirements. The requirements and the roles can be highlighted according to the following diagram:

**Knowledge Areas**
The BABOK guide's contents are structured into separate chapters for the following ‘Knowledge Areas’ of business analysis:
1.	Business analysis planning and monitoring – It explains how to decide what is needed to be done to complete an analyst effort (in other words, how to plan the project). This knowledge area helps to intelligently decide which stakeholders, tools, tasks and techniques that are needed to get the job done
2.	Enterprise analysis – It outlines the crucial process of keeping everyone in the loop and on the same page regarding the project's direction and progress
3.	Requirements analysis – It elaborates how to write and state the requirements that can meet the business needs. The key sections of this area include the methods for prioritizing and organizing the requirements, and the most beneficial techniques for requirements presentation (state diagrams, prototyping, data flow diagrams, and process modelling)
4.	Requirements elicitation – It describes the interview and research process and how to successfully extract the needs from the stakeholders. Some of the topics covered include elements such as metrics (tracking the amount of time spent eliciting requirements) and the elicitation techniques (prototyping and brainstorming) 
5.	Requirements management and communication – It describes how to identify business needs and state the scope of the solutions. The topics cover the SMART criteria of measurement, along with SWOT analysis and other measurement factors that make the identification of this root cause data objective and tangible
6.	Underlying competencies - It describes the behaviours and competencies that are common to good analysts (such as innovative thinking, learning one's business and industry, practicing good organizational skills, and ethics)
7.	Techniques – It covers the myriad techniques that the business analysts use to accomplish their work. There are 34 techniques listed in the Techniques section along with another 15 defined within the knowledge areas. Some of them include benchmarking, decision analysis, document analysis, estimation, focus groups, functional decomposition, interface analysis, interviews, brainstorming, data dictionaries and glossaries, risk analysis, root cause analysis, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, structured walkthrough, survey/questionnaire, scenarios and use cases, data flow diagrams, data modeling, lessons learned process, metrics and key performance indicators, observation, organization modeling, problem tracking, process modeling, prototyping, requirements workshops, scope modeling, SWOT analysis, and vendor assessment
8.	Solution assessment and validation – It gives a detailed description on how to choose the best solutions for specific business needs. It helps to understand the risks, dependencies, and limitations that must be identified before proposing any solution.

**Benefits of BABOK for the Business Analysts**
A thorough knowledge of BABOK can help the business analysts in several ways:
1.	Analysts have an authoritative and concise encyclopaedia that lays down what they are expected to know in order to be considered knowledgeable and competent
2.	Analysts have the cutting edge of their field, knowing that they are convenient with the most current practices of business analysis 
3.	Analysts have the knowledge of an inclusive list of techniques and concepts, and the details regarding their successful implementation
4.	Since the BABOK guide is global, it offers a standard for the entire business analysis profession, regardless of the region or industry
5.	BABOK serves as a common denominator across the profession, thereby setting a uniform standard of what the business analysis encompasses

**Overlap of BABOK and ITIL**//[[itil|Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)]]//
Service Strategy, Service Design and Continual Service Improvement (CSI) are engaged in the thorough understanding of the business requirements in order to meet the business requirements. In particular, Service Design covers many areas of business analysis thoroughly, (such as interviewing and prototyping). Service Design also has a very good Requirements Template. ITIL refers to Requirements Analysis as ‘Requirements Engineering’ and as such it offers a lot of material that can be of great value for the business analysts. BABOK can also benefit greatly from the ‘Service’ and ‘Process’ descriptions and guidelines of ITIL. 
BABOK lays down the guidelines for transition requirements and the process of defining, and deploying these can be much clearer by use of the Service Transition book that would also help by more clearly defining the interface to Change Management. Experienced Business Analysts who use BABOK as a reference have very specific skills that can complement the Service Management engagement. Their experience and training can help them to elicit the well formed requirements and then define and communicate them clearly and precisely. BABOK also provides more considered and up-to-date material from the field of business analysis, than the guide in Service Design. BABOK also provides a good conceptual framework to gather and manage the requirements and it can be very effective with the complementary integration of BABOK and ITIL. 
Some of the specific links that can be found between the processes of BABOK and ITIL are:
1.	CSI with Elicitation – The CSI of ITIL uses an understanding of the Business Vision and Goals as a starting point, just as the Elicitation Process of BABOK uses Enterprise Analysis as the starting point. Both of them acknowledge the fact that the requirements for improvement can only make sense within the Business Context and they have to go through a multiple stage refinement process to prioritise those that can deliver the highest value to cost ratio
2.	Service Strategy with Enterprise Analysis & Elicitation – The Enterprise Analysis & Elicitation of BABOK as well as the Service Strategy of ITIL explores the Market Spaces and Business Opportunities and maps them to the existing product and service solutions
3.	Service Design with “Enterprise Analysis + Requirements Analysis + Solution Assessment & Validation” – The largest area for the overlap of ITIL with BABOK is at Service Design. The Service Design Package (SDP) is the central part of the Service Portfolio of ITIL that relates to Business Analysis 
4.	Service Transition with Business Analysis Planning & Monitoring – The requirement of business analysis is covered quite well in the Service Transition volume of ITIL. The V- Diagram and its components of Service Transition can be improved by recognising the role of Business Analysis in Planning and Monitoring as well as in the Enterprise Analysis and Requirements Analysis processes
