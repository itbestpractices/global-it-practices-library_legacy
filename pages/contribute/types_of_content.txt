===== Types of library content =====

In this Library, various types of content are used. By reading this page you will understand all the content types, how they relate and how to add more content.

Following these guidelines will create consistency across the library and therefore better useability for both first time and more experienced users users.

=== Overview ===

They are all subtypes of [[:contribute:types of content#Community Agreements|Community Agreements]] and each have a specific type of information they are conveying. The following diagram gives an overview of the relationship between the various types, a decision flowchart is also given at the bottom of the page to determine which type of content to add.

=== Principles ===

The principles that the organization abides by. They are usually described in idealistic terms like honestly, respect, priorities, etc.

   (usually plural) Moral rule or aspect.   
   
   I don't doubt your principles; you are clearly a person of principle.
   It's the principle of the thing; I won't do business with someone I
   can't trust.   

[[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/principle|"principle" (Definition #3) on Wiktionary]]

**Examples**
  * Our organization has the ambition to be above average in reducing carbon emissions by 10% across our industry.
  * We will not work overtime with very rare exceptions to allow for a fair work-life balance.

=== Policies ===

   A policy is a principle or rule to guide decisions and achieve 
   rational outcomes. A policy is a statement of intent, and is 
   implemented as a procedure[1] or protocol. Policies are generally 
   adopted by the Board of or senior governance body within an 
   organization whereas procedures or protocols would be developed 
   and adopted by senior executive officers. Policies can assist in 
   both subjective and objective decision making. Policies to assist 
   in subjective decision making would usually assist senior management 
   with decisions that must consider the relative merits of a number of 
   factors before making decisions and as a result are often hard to 
   objectively test e.g. work-life balance policy. In contrast policies 
   to assist in objective decision making are usually operational in 
   nature and can be objectively tested e.g. password policy

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy|"Policies" on WikiPedia]]

**Examples**
  * Every person entering our building has to be registered
  * All employees have to be registered with our Industry Body of Knowledge

=== Processes ===

   A business process or business method is a collection of related,
   structured activities or tasks that produce a specific service 
   or product (serve a particular goal) for a particular customer 
   or customers. It often can be visualized with a flowchart as a 
   sequence of activities with interleaving decision points or with 
   a Process Matrix as a sequence of activities with relevance rules 
   based on the data in the process.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_process|"Business Process" on WikiPedia]]

**Examples**
[[:contribute#The high level process|The high level Contribute Process]]
[[:process:implement features|Implement Features]]

=== Standards ===

Standard are the specific methods employed to express policies in action within the operations of the organization. These will include high level requirements to be carried out by the end user to comply with the policy rules. Each Standard will contain a purpose, exceptions and requirements. Standard changes are triggered by Policy or Process changes.

   A technical standard is an established norm or requirement in 
   regard to technical systems. It is usually a formal document that 
   establishes uniform engineering or technical criteria, methods, 
   processes and practices.
   
   In contrast, a custom, convention, company product, corporate 
   standard, etc. that becomes generally accepted and dominant is often 
   called a de facto standard.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_standard|"Technical Standard" on WikiPedia]]

**Examples**
[[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1459.html|IRC Chat Protocal]]
[[http://webstore.iec.ch/preview/info_iec60908(ed2.0)b.pdf|CD Audio Standard (IEC)]]

=== Best Practices ===

   A best practice is a method or technique that has consistently 
   shown results superior to those achieved with other means, and 
   that is used as a benchmark. In addition, a "best" practice can 
   evolve to become better as improvements are discovered. Best practice 
   is considered by some as a business buzzword, used to describe the 
   process of developing and following a standard way of doing things 
   that multiple organizations can use.
   
   Best practices are used to maintain quality as an alternative to 
   mandatory legislated standards and can be based on self-assessment or benchmarking

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice|"Best Practice" on WikiPedia]]

**Examples**
[[:todo|Todo]]
[[:todo|Todo]]


=== Deliverables ===

[[:todo|todo]]

**Examples**

[[:todo|todo]]


=== Templates ===

[[:todo|todo]]


=== Tools ===

Software tooling is an important part of IT Efficiency Improvements and is probably also the hardest to apply. It requires thorough research in the requirements for the particular tool, an evaluation of the available options and finally advising management on the direction, given the organizational constraints, strategy and potentially the politics.

They form the link between the various other content types as advise on tools takes inputs from:
  * [[:contribute:types of content#processes|Processes]]
  * [[:contribute:types of content#standards|Standards]]
  * [[:contribute:types of content#best practices|Best Practices]]

And the tools need to address the requirements to deliver:
  * [[:contribute:types of content#metrics|Metrics]]

Furthermore, people might have contributed [[:contribute:types of content#job-aids|Job-Aids]] to help to use the tools to their fullest capacity.

**Examples**
[[:todo|Todo]]
[[:todo|Todo]]

=== Community Agreements ===

All the above content is agreed by [[:contribute#The teams within the PII|communities of experts]], either internal to the [[http://go/navigate|organization]] or external as part of the [[http://www.alm-community.org|Global ALM Community]].

The "Community Agreements" is a super-type that encapsulates all other types, therefore all content that is added to this library has been agreed by the communities.

By applying a [[:contribute#The high level process|lean process]] the effort of submitting improvements to this library is brought to a minimum.

From the perspective of an employee that is not participating in the Process Improvement Infrastructure (PII), the process is:
  * Go the standard library: "http://go/standards"
  * Click on the "Propose an Improvement" in the bottom right corner.
  * Fill in the details and click "Save".
  * After the SEPG has agreed the proposal is indeed an improvement, you will receive an email that a workspace has been created for you to implement the improvement. This email will also give guidance on the expected changes to be made to the library to maintain its consistency. This usually includes things like plans to increase the adoption and training.
  * You make the changes and submit them for approval.

This whole process could be a matter of hours, depending on the timing of submission of the idea and the SEPG meetings.


=== Difference between Standards, Best Practices, Job aids and Templates ===

Marilou Myrick put the difference between Standards and Best Practices quite well in her [[http://www.thestage1.com/2011/03/03/standards-or-best-practices|blog post]]

   Standards describe how to comply and are usually governed by a authoritative body.
   Best Practices describe effective practices to achieve goals and are back-ed up with evidence.
   Job aids on the other hand give guidance on **how** to perform a particular task (that is not a formal process activity).
   Templates are artefacts that can/should be used within processes as a starting point to complete.
