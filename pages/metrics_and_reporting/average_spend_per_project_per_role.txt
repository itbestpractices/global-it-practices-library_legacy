===== Metric: Average Spend per Project per Role =====

** Description: **

This metric is a very rough indication on historic efforts per project for each role.

Effort classification: Low

** Benefits: **

Historic spend can be used as input for estimating the funding requirements for future projects.

** Disadvantages and Risks of not doing it: **					

If there are other metrics that are more accurately presenting the effort spend in previous projects, then it's obviously a good idea to use those in stead. However, in some cases, this metric is the best you are going to get.

Without this information (via this metric of otherwise) estimating is much harder as it cannot be validated against previous experiences.
