===== Metrics and Reporting =====

==== Description ====

This area describes the various metrics we can get out of the ALM Processes and also describes various ways they can be represented (Reports, Lists, Notifications, etc)

Higher maturity metrics are not available for lower maturity level processes. The [[:maturity:maturity_overview|"ALM Maturity Model"]] covers which practices are executed at which level and also gives guidance on how to execute them and to increase maturity.





==== Maturity ====



org = Organisation, eff = Efficiency

Please read the information about the [[:organization_categories|Organisation Categories]] before proceeding as not all reporting might be applicable.
