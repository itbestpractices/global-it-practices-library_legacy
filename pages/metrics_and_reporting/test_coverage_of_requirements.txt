===== Metric: Test Coverage of Requirements =====

** Description: **
This metric shows the risk profile during testing. Not all requirements have to be tested with every release, which saves effort and therefore money. However, there is always a risk that changes did unexpectedly impact the untested areas. This metric specifies the risk taken. 

It can be a single number to specify the average risk across the release and it can be combined with feature information to specify the risk per feature. This is typically presented in drill-down UI interactions.
