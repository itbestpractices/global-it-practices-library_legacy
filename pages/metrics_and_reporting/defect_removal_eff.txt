** Description: **

This metric describes how efficient found defects are removed from the product.

Effort classification: Low



** Benefits: **

By measuring the efficiency, we know whether or not there are opportunities to improve. This can be across the board or per feature/cluster.

** Disadvantages and Risks of not doing it: **					

There is a risk of undetected inefficiencies and therefore lower teams velocity.

** Inputs **
^ Inputs: ^ Measured by: ^
| Features |  |
| TimeStamp of defect found | The test management system records the timestamp when the defect is raised. The tester needs to specify the feature to which this defect is related. |
| TimeStamp of defect resolved | The test management system records the timestamp when the defect is marked resolved. |
