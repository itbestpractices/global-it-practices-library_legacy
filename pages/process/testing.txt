===== Process: Testing =====

==== Description ====

The IT testing process is highly aligned with the ITSQB processes. There are slight differences though, as ISTQB doesn't take other frameworks into consideration and therefore only takes a testers perspective on ALM. That is not a bad thing as it happens to be the scope. But this ALM Library takes a holistic approach to increasing IT Efficiency across the SDLC, balancing effort/benefits across the various competencies.
