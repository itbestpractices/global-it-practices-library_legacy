==== Description ====

<<DESCRIPTION>>

/*

This is where the process maps go. The Rigrr library will render BPMN notation inline. 
See below for the syntax. You can create your own process maps by visiting:
http://rigrr.rapilabs.com 

Or you can extend the "Rigrr Dokuwiki Plugin" with DokuWiki editor integration that provides 
you with an "Edit BPMN" option in the DokuWiki toolbar.
