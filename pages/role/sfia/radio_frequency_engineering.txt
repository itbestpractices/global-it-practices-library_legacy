===== Role: Radio frequency engineering (RFEN) =====

==== Description ====
The deployment, integration, calibration, tuning and maintenance of radio frequency (RF) and analogue elements of IT systems. 

==== SFIA Level 2 ====
Assists with setting up, tuning and functional checks of radio frequency/analogue elements. Resolves faults down to line replaceable unit (LRU) level or escalates according to given procedures. Carries out user confidence checks and escalates faults according to given procedures.

==== SFIA Level 3 ====
Deploys, sets up, tunes and calibrates radio frequency/analogue elements following maintenance schedules and using appropriate tools and test equipment. Incorporates hardware/ firmware modifications. Interprets automatic fault/performance indications and resolves faults down to discrete component level or escalates according to given procedures. 

==== SFIA Level 4 ====
Investigates and resolves system-wide fault conditions using a wide range of diagnostic tools and techniques. Reconfigures equipment to circumvent temporary outages. 

==== SFIA Level 5 ====
Develops maintenance schedules and procedures. Approves equipment upgrades and modifications. Monitors system performance, recommends equipment modifications and changes to operating procedures, servicing methods and schedules. 

==== SFIA Level 6 ====
Specifies radio frequency equipment performance requirements and sets maintenance policy. 

==== Processes ====
