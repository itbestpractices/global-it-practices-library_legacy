===== Role: Solution architecture (ARCH) =====

==== Description ====
The design and communication of high-level structures to enable and guide the design and development of integrated solutions that meet current and future business needs.Changes to service, process, organisation, operating model and other aspects may be required in addition to technology components, and solutions must demonstrate how agreed requirements (such as automation of business processes) are met, any requirements which are not fully met or, and any options or considerations which require a business decision. The provision of comprehensive guidance on the
development of, and modifications to, solution components to ensure that they take account of
relevant architectures, strategies, policies, standards and practices and that existing and planned solution components remain compatible.

==== SFIA Level 5 ====
Uses appropriate tools, including logical models of components and interfaces, to contribute to the development of systems architectures in specific business or functional areas. Produces detailed component specifications and translates these into detailed designs for implementation using selected products. Within a business change programme, assists in the preparation of technical plans and cooperates with business assurance and project staff to ensure that appropriate technical resources are made available. Provides advice on technical aspects of system development and integration (including requests for changes, deviations from specifications, etc.) and ensures that relevant technical strategies, policies,standards and practices are applied correctly.

==== SFIA Level 6 ====
Leads the development of architectures for complex systems,ensuring consistency with specified requirements agreed with both external, and internal customers. Takes full responsibility for the
balance between functional, service quality and systems management requirements within a
significant area of the organisation. Establishes policy and strategy for the selection of systems
architecture components, and co-ordinates design activities, promoting the discipline to
ensure consistency. Ensures that appropriate standards (corporate, industry, national and
