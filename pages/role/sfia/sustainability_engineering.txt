===== Role: Sustainability engineering (SUEN) =====

==== Description ====
The application of appropriate methods to assure sustainability in all phases of the life cycle of energy- or materials-consuming systems and services, including maintenance and re-use. These include such things as energy supply risk analysis, specification of materials procurement guidelines, factors influencing system design, and the verification of energy efficiency. 

==== SFIA Level 4 ====
Investigates and recommends components and subsystems that meet sustainability criteria. 

==== SFIA Level 5 ====
Designs systems, services and components that meet required levels of sustainability and specific profiles of materials consumption. 

==== SFIA Level 6 ====
6 Creates models to ensure that new systems and services are designed to achieve specified levels of sustainability and to optimise the consumption and recycling of materials. Defines and promulgates best practices in sustainability.
