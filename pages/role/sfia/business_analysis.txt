==== The Key Responsibilities of a Business Analyst. ====

Even thought the business analyst has a vital role in IT project, the role doesn't necessarily involve IT. The primary focus is to "enable the organization to achieve its goals", which almost always means "improve business processes and tools". As many processes are automated in this day and age, this will likely include some change to IT and hence the involvement in IT teams. However the role of the business analyst is much bigger.

Therefore, withing the scope of ALM processes, a business analyst is responsible for the following:


    Elicitation - Discovering the underlying business need to be addressed 
    and information related to the product and project requirements, often 
    through conversations with stakeholders.
    
    Analyzing Requirements - Organizing, specifying and modeling the requirements 
    to ensure they are complete and unambiguous.
    
    Specifying Requirements - Documenting the requirements in a format that can
    be shared with stakeholders.
    
    Validating and Verifying Requirements - Ensuring the requirements map to the 
    real business need, are approved by all relevant stakeholders, and meet 
    essential quality standards.
