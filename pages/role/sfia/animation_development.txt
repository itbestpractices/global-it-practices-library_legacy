===== Role: Animation development (ADEV) =====

==== Description ====
The architecture, design and development of animated and interactive systems such as games and simulations. 

==== SFIA Level 3 ====
Uses design tools (such as wireframes) to evolve prototypes of web pages. Using complex visual design tools, employs organic modelling techniques, such as boned rigs to create and animate virtual charac-ters within the context of a game (or similar system) design. Builds visual and audio components.

==== SFIA Level 4 ====
Uses design tools (such as wireframes) to evolve rapid prototypes of web pages, and assess the viability of design concepts. Using complex visual design tools, employs organic modelling techniques, such as boned rigs to create and animate virtual characters within the context of a game (or similar system) design. Builds visual and audio components and integrates them into the system structure, typically using a games engine. 

==== SFIA Level 5 ====
Develops conceptual structures into design blueprints, typically using tools such as interaction diagrams and wireframes, to create high-level structures and runtime architectures for websites. Manages iterations of level design and storytelling, documenting overall flow and architecture of a game or similar system

==== SFIA Level 6 ====
Provides overall creative direction in the conception and design of animation products such as games and simulations. 

==== Processes ====
