The main responsibility of Iteration Manager is “building well-oiled delivery machine, continually feeding it story cards, and tuning the machine”.

Generally, the Iteration Manager role is close to the one role from Scrum – Scrum Master. In short, the IM should focus in the following areas:
  * The Team – track iteration’s progress (day-to-day work), report impediments, make sure iteration’s commitment will be fulfilled, point bottlenecks in the delivery process.
  * The Customer – act as gatekeeper, protect team from distractions, keep customer from changing requirements.
  * The Iteration – plan team’s budget (ideal hours), help customer with prioritization, motivate team, owns iteration planning and retrospective.
  * The Project – form group of people working together towards common goal (they success or fail together); IM needs to aim for productive and happy team members and satisfied customer.
